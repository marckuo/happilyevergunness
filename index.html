      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p class="text">
      On June 16th and 17th, you have been invited to the Royal Wedding of Princess Sinthurella and Prince Chris Jeremey Gunness. To be invited to this event is one of the highest honours one could receive, maybe even higher than a Nobel or Pulitzer Prize. This event may only be two days, but it has taken years to build up to.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      In the land of the Raptors and Leafs, Chris Jeremey Gunness was born on a cold winter day. Born curious and always up to trouble, he gave his parents a handful and grey hairs at a young age. Raised in Scarborough and Markham, he was always surrounded by family and friends. Family would guide him and friends would lead him to discover things he would have never done on his own.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Just like in every fairy tale, Sinthurella was found far far away. Sinthurella came to Canada at a young age, and stayed in East York. As she was about to begin high school, she moved to Markham. Just like Chris, she was always surrounded by family, friends and protectors. Anyone trying to sway Sinthurella was met with harsh consequences. With style and grace, she excelled in everything she put her mind to.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      Now, the beginnings of the Gunness/Chandramohan connection begins in Middlefield Collegiate Institute. Many chance encounters and simple salutations were exchanged throughout the years, as Chris and Sinthurella knew each other, yet never got to truly know each other. Some say Sinthurella was too popular to speak to Chris, while others say Chris was simply too cool to speak with Sinthurella. Regardless, Chris knew Sinthurella was going through some hardship and decided to add her on MSN. Through the beauty of instant chat messages, a bond was formed that will never be broken.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      This bond culminated on the evening of September 13th, 2008. Known for his strong confidence, this day Chris was weak in the knees as he was going to tell the one he knew he would marry how he felt. But how would he do it? He never felt like this before, the insecurity of the unknown. He knew just the remedy: Rum! One shot...(ok maybe a few more than that) got him ready to go as he pronounced his love for Sinthurella. He was met with surprise, and then jubilation. Success! He had successfully finished the first step to his lifetime of happiness with Sinthurella.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      8 years to the date, Chris decided to propose to Sinthurella, and once again she accepted in jubilation! All the schools, assignments, exams, jobs, cars, hairstyles, nicknames, clothes, shoes, arguments, make-ups, discoveries, countries, gifts, surprises etc. over the years that they had both been a part of led up to this. It was time to make that next step to becoming the Gunness'. And they are perfect for each other. Before Chris' hygiene could be questionable at times, but Sinthurella swooped in and cleaned him up and gave him style. And Sinthurella encounters math on a daily basis, and she uses her Chris as a calculator to see how much she can spend in the mall. Through everything, they always had each others' backs and supported each other whole heartedly.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      June 16th and 17th will be another huge chapter for Chris and Sinthu. Most of you have already seen their love blossom over the years, and now you have been invited to witness them express this through marriage. Their love story would be incomplete without all the support you have given them over the years. So come eat, drink and be merry and celebrate with the newly wed Gunness'!
